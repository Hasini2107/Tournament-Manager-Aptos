# Tournament Manager

## Project Description

Tournament Manager is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables the creation and management of elimination tournament brackets. The system allows tournament organizers to create tournaments with multiple participants and track match results through elimination rounds until a final winner is determined. Each tournament maintains a complete record of all matches, participants, and results on-chain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize tournament management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and decentralized platform for competitive events. We aim to eliminate the need for centralized tournament organizers and provide a fair, automated system where results are permanently recorded and verifiable by all participants. This creates an ecosystem where competitive integrity is guaranteed through smart contract logic and blockchain immutability.
